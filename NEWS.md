# eulerr 1.0.0

## New features
* Final optimization routines have been completely rewritten in C++ using Rcpp
and RcppArmadillo.
* Switched to the cost function from EulerAPE for the default optimization
target but added the posibility to choose cost function via a `cost` argument
(currently `eulerAPE` or `venneuler`).
* Added the option to produce conditional eulerr plots via a `by` argument to
`eulerr`. The result is a list of euler diagrams that can be plotted
in a grid arrangement via a new plot method.
* Improved label placement by using a two-dimensional kernel density estimation
instead of means to calculate label centers.

## Bug fixes and minor improvements
* Cleaned up typos and grammar errors in the _Introduction to eulerr_ vignette.
* Added `mar` argument to `plot.eulerr` with a default that produces
symmetric margins.
* Corrected the implementation of the `stress` statistic from venneuler.
* Switched to Vogel sampling to generate points to choose label positions from.
* Minor clean up and performance fixes all around.
* Added a `print.eulerr` method.
* Updated vignette to cover new features and changes.

# eulerr 0.1.0
* The first release.
