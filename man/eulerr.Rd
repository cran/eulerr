\details{
Compute Euler diagrams (a generalization of Venn diagrams) using
numerical optimization to find exact or approximate solutions to a
specification of set relationships.

If \code{by} is specified, \code{eulerr} returns a list of euler diagrams
that can be plotted in facets via a special plot method.

The fit is optimized using either the cost function used in the
eulerAPE software package or the stress statistic of the R package
\pkg{venneuler}. The eulerAPE cost function is defined as

\deqn{%
  \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{(y_i - \hat{y}_i) ^ 2}{\hat{y}_i}
}{%
  (1 / n) \sum (orig - fit) / \sum fit
}

where \eqn{\hat{y}}{fit} are the estimates of \eqn{y} that are currently
explored during optimization. For \code{venneuler}, the stress function is
defined as

\deqn{%
  \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i) ^ 2}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i ^ 2}
}{%
  (\sum (fit - orig) ^ 2) / (\sum orig ^ 2)
}

where \eqn{\hat{y}}{fit} are OLS estimates from the regression of the fitted
areas on the original areas that are currently being explored during
optimization.

\section{Methods (by class)}{
\itemize{
\item \code{default}: A named numeric vector, with
interactions seperated by an ampersand, for instance \code{`A&B` = 10}.
Missing interactions are treated as being 0.

\item \code{matrix}: A matrix of logical vectors with columns representing sets
and rows representing each observation's set relationships (see examples).

\item \code{data.frame}: A data.frame that can be converted to a matrix of logicals
(as in the description above) via \code{\link[base]{as.matrix}}.
